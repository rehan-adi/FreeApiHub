# API Usage Guide

Welcome to the API Usage Guide! Here, you’ll find everything you need to start using **FreeApiHub** APIs effectively in your projects.

### Making Your First Request

Each API can be accessed using a simple GET request following this URL format:

```bash
GET https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/{api_name}
```

Example URLs for Each API

User API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/randomusers<br />
Product API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/projects<br />
Jokes API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/jokes<br />
Books API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books<br />
Quote API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes<br />
Stock API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/stocks<br />
Programming Language API: https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages

### Request Format

To make a request, you can use your preferred HTTP client (e.g., Axios or fetch JavaScript, or tools like Postman and cURL). Here’s an example using JavaScript fetch:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://example.com/api/v1/endpoint")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Data:", response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

Using curl from the Command Line

```bash
curl -X GET "https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/randomusers"
```

### Example Using Postman

Open Postman and create a new request.<br />
Select GET as the request method.<br />
Enter the desired API URL (e.g., https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/randomusers).<br />
Click Send to view the response.

### Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format to ensure easy integration. Below is an example of a response from the User API:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "cm2ivfrdc0002fo4ch5zi0car",
      "gender": "male",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "username": "johndoe123",
      "password": "password123",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "age": 34,
      "streetNumber": 123,
      "streetName": "Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "state": "California",
      "country": "USA",
      "postcode": 90210,
      "picture": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/1.jpg",
      "nationality": "American",
      "createdAt": "2024-10-21T10:26:09.061Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-10-21T10:26:09.061Z"
    }
  ],
  "message": "All users retrieved successfully"
}
```

### Common Fields in Responses

id: A unique identifier for the record.<br />
success: A boolean value indicating whether the API request was successful (true) or if there was an error (false). This field helps you quickly determine the outcome of your request.<br />
message: A string providing context about the response, such as success confirmation or error details. This field can vary by endpoint and offers insights into the nature of the response, making it easier to debug issues or confirm data retrieval.<br />

### Swagger API Documentation

To enhance your experience with the FreeApiHub APIs, we provide an interactive **Swagger UI** that allows you to test the APIs directly from your browser. Swagger makes it easy to explore the available endpoints, view request and response formats, and execute API calls in real-time.

You can access the Swagger documentation here: [Swagger Guide](/docs/swagger).

With Swagger, you can easily understand how to interact with the FreeApiHub APIs and test them without writing any code.

### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair use and consistent access, FreeApiHub enforces rate limits on API calls. For most endpoints, the default limit is 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you may receive a 429 Too Many Requests error.

### Best Practices

Error Handling: Always include error handling to catch unexpected responses or network issues.<br />
Efficient Data Usage: Request only the data you need by using query parameters to minimize payload size.<br />
Rate Limiting: Respect rate limits to prevent access disruptions and maintain reliable API performance.
