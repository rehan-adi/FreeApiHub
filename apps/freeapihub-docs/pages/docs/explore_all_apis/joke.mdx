# Joke API

The **Joke API** provides access to random jokes, ideal for adding humor to your applications or for testing purposes.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/jokes
```

### Get Joke Data by ID

To retrieve joke data by ID, you can use the following endpoint:

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/joke/:id
```

Replace :id with the actual joke ID you want to fetch.

### Installation

To use the Joke API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```
### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch random joke data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/jokes")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

Here's how to fetch joke data by id using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

const id = "1a2b3c4d"; // Replace with actual joke ID

axios
  .get(`https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/jokes/${id}`)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching user data by ID:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting random joke data:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "fd481681-bc6b-4e2d-8ed9-c95a85c23f15",
            "author": "Jane Smith",
            "content": "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
            "rate": 4,
            "likes": 250,
            "dislikes": 5,
            "category": "Science Humor"
        },
    ],
    "message": "All jokes retrieved successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Joke API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a `try...catch` block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching user data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchJoke() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/jokes");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching joke: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchJoke();
```

### Usage Tips
