# Product API

The **Product API** provides access to product data, making it easy to retrieve information on various products for e-commerce applications, cataloging, or testing purposes.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://api.freeapihub.com/product
```

### Installation

To use the Product API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://api.freeapihub.com/product")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    12;
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting book data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Wireless Headphones",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "price": 59.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation.",
    "stock": 25,
    "imageUrl": "https://api.freeapihub.com/product/images/wireless_headphones.jpg"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Product API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a try...catch block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching book data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchProductData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://api.freeapihub.com/product");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching product data: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchProductData();
```

### Usage Tips

- Use the Product API to retrieve product data for e-commerce applications, product listings, or inventory management systems.
- Experiment with different API calls to explore the variety of products available and to understand the structure and attributes returned.
- For a deeper understanding of how to effectively use APIs, refer to the API Usage Guide.
