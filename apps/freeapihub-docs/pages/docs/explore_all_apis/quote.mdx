# Quote API

The **Quote API** provides access to random quotes, ideal for adding inspiration to your applications or for testing purposes.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes
```

### Get quote Data by ID

To retrieve quote data by ID, you can use the following endpoint:

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes/:quoteId
```

Replace : quoteId with the actual quote ID you want to fetch.

### Installation

To use the Quote API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch random quote data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

Here's how to fetch quote data by quoteId using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

const quoteId = "1a2b3c4d"; // Replace with actual quote ID

axios
  .get(`https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes/${quoteId}`)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data by ID:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting random quote data:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "e27c6a1b-d8a6-4b45-98bb-1c70ed8cb8d1",
      "author": "Albert Einstein",
      "content": "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.",
      "rate": 5,
      "likes": 150,
      "dislikes": 2,
      "category": "Motivation"
    },
    {
      "id": "f39a4587-6a2f-4b45-9f44-fc7fa1b4e53c",
      "author": "Maya Angelou",
      "content": "You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.",
      "rate": 4,
      "likes": 120,
      "dislikes": 3,
      "category": "Inspiration"
    }
  ],
  "message": "All quotes retrieved successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Quote API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a `try...catch` block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching quote data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchQuote() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/quotes"
    );
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching quote data: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchQuote();
```
