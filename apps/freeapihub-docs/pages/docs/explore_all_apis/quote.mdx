# Quote API

The **Quote API** provides access to random quotes, ideal for adding inspiration to your applications or for testing purposes.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://api.freeapihub.com/quote
```


### Installation

To use the Quote API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```
### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch random quote data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://api.freeapihub.com/quote")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting random quote data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "quote": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
    "category": "General"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Quote API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a `try...catch` block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching user data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchQuote() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://api.freeapihub.com/quote");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching quote: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchQuote();
```
