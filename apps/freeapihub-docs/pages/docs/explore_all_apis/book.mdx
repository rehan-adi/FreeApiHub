# Book API

The **Book API** provides access to book data, ideal for retrieving information on books for your applications or for testing purposes.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books
```

### Get book Data by ID

To retrieve book data by ID, you can use the following endpoint:

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books/:bookId
```

**Replace** : bookId with the actual book ID you want to fetch.

### Installation

To use the Book API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

Here's how to fetch book data by bookId using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

const bookId = "1a2b3c4d"; // Replace with actual book ID

axios
  .get(`https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books/${bookId}`)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data by ID:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting book data:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "247fe5aa-f555-421c-8b5a-ca01205b6e75",
      "name": "Rich Dad Poor Dad",
      "author": "Robert T. Kiyosaki",
      "description": "A personal finance book advocating financial independence and wealth building through investments and entrepreneurship.",
      "publisher": "Warner Books",
      "publishedAt": "1997-04-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "genre": "Personal Finance",
      "pages": 207,
      "imageUrl": "https://imgs.search.brave.com/afSCRJDsicrWJxQZczfsJlhPfZFFTdmLdc6okfGhpQ8/rs:fit:500:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tLm1l/ZGlhLWFtYXpvbi5j/b20vaW1hZ2VzL0kv/ODFCRTdlZUt6QUwu/anBn",
      "rating": 4.6
    }
  ],
  "message": "All books retrieved successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Book API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a try...catch block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching book data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchBookData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/books");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching book data: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchBookData();
```

### Usage Tips

- Use the Book API to retrieve book data for various applications, such as recommendation engines or digital libraries.
- Experiment with different API calls to explore the variety of books available and to understand the structure and attributes returned.
