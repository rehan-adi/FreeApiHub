#  Programming Language API

The **Programming Language API** provides information about different programming languages, their uses, paradigms, and release details. This API is ideal for educational applications, language comparisons, or adding dynamic content related to programming.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages
```

### Get Language Data by ID

To retrieve programming language data by ID, you can use the following endpoint:

```shell
https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages/:languageId
```

**Replace** : languageId with the actual programming language ID you want to fetch.

### Installation

To use the Programming Language API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch programming language data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

Here's how to fetch programming language data by id using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

const languageId = "1a2b3c4d"; // Replace with actual language ID

axios
  .get(`https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages/${languageId}`)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching joke data by ID:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting programming language data:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "f4a54c6d-5f2b-472e-bdd3-a1d3b63a678d",
      "name": "JavaScript",
      "description": "JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development.",
      "logoUrl": "https://example.com/javascript-logo.png",
      "creator": "Brendan Eich",
      "foundationYear": 1995,
      "popularity": 10,
      "marketDemand": 9,
      "industryUse": "Web Development, Mobile Applications, Server-Side Development",
      "type": "Interpreted",
      "version": "ES6",
      "learningDifficulty": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "ab9c8d9e-fc5d-48df-89c5-87323d5fe77b",
      "name": "Rust",
      "description": "Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.",

      "industryUse": "Systems Programming, Embedded Systems, WebAssembly",
      "type": "Compiled",
      "version": "1.54.0",
      "learningDifficulty": 4
    }
  ],
  "message": "All programming languages retrieved successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Programming Language API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a try...catch block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching programming language data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchProgrammingLanguageData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api/v1/programming-languages");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching programming language data: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchProgrammingLanguageData();
```

### Usage Tips

- Use the Programming Language API to retrieve data for educational tools, language comparison charts, or for showcasing popular languages on your platform.
- Experiment with different API calls to explore the range of languages and details available.
- For a deeper understanding of how to effectively use APIs, refer to the API Usage Guide.
