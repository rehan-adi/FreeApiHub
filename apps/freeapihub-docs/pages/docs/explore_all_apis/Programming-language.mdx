#  Programming Language API

The **Programming Language API** provides information about different programming languages, their uses, paradigms, and release details. This API is ideal for educational applications, language comparisons, or adding dynamic content related to programming.

### Endpoint

```shell
https://api.freeapihub.com/programming-language
```

### Installation

To use the Programming Language API, you'll need to install Axios. You can do this using either npm or pnpm:

**Note**: Run these commands in your project directory to install Axios.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add axios
```

### Example Usage

Here's how to fetch programming language data using Axios:

```tsx
import axios from "axios";

axios
  .get("https://api.freeapihub.com/programming-language")
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    12;
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

### Response Format

Below is a sample JSON response when requesting programming language data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "python",
    "name": "Python",
    "paradigm": ["Object-Oriented", "Procedural", "Functional"],
    "firstAppeared": 1991,
    "developer": "Guido van Rossum",
    "description": "A high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and versatility.",
    "latestVersion": "3.10.2",
    "website": "https://www.python.org"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

When using the Programming Language API, it's essential to handle potential errors effectively. Below are common error codes you may encounter:

| Error Code | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 404        | Resource not found             |
| 429        | Too many requests (rate limit) |

### Example Error Handling

To manage potential errors gracefully, you can use a try...catch block in your Axios requests. Here's an example of how to implement error handling when fetching book data:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchProgrammingLanguageData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://api.freeapihub.com/programming-language");
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      "Error fetching programming language data: ",
      error.response?.data?.message || "An unexpected error occurred."
    );
  }
}

fetchProgrammingLanguageData();
```

### Usage Tips

- Use the Programming Language API to retrieve data for educational tools, language comparison charts, or for showcasing popular languages on your platform.
- Experiment with different API calls to explore the range of languages and details available.
