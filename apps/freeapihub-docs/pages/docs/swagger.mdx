# Swagger API Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Swagger API Guide**! This guide will help you explore and test **FreeApiHub** APIs directly from your browser using our interactive Swagger UI.

## What is Swagger?

**Swagger** is a user-friendly interface for testing APIs. It displays available endpoints, how to use them, and what to expect in responses â€” all without writing code.

### Accessing Swagger UI

To get started, open the Swagger UI for FreeApiHub: [Swagger UI](https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api-docs). Youâ€™ll see a list of available APIs organized by category.

## Exploring Endpoints

### Step 1: View Available APIs

When you open the Swagger UI, youâ€™ll see a list of API categories. Each category expands to show available endpoints.

1. **Fetch All Data**: Lists all data in a category.
2. **Fetch by ID**: Retrieves a specific entry by its unique identifier (ID).

### Step 2: Selecting an Endpoint

Click on any endpoint (like "GET /books") to view details such as description and sample response.


## Making a Request

### Step 3: Executing a GET Request

No additional parameters are needed, as these endpoints either retrieve all entries or a single entry by ID. To make a request:

1. **For all data**: Click **Try it out** for the endpoint (like `GET /books`) and select **Execute** to retrieve all data.
2. **For a specific item**: Enter the itemâ€™s ID in the provided field under the `GET /books/{id}` endpoint and click **Execute**.

### Step 4: View the Response

Swagger displays the response with three main parts:

- **Status Code**: Indicates request success (e.g., `200 OK`) or error.
- **Response Body**: Shows JSON data retrieved from the API.
- **Response Headers**: Provides extra details like content type.

### Tips for Using Swagger

- **Explore**: Test different endpoints and responses.
- **Experiment**: Try retrieving data for specific IDs.
- **Use the Documentation**: See the [API Usage Guide](/docs/guide) for more details.

### Quick Start
1. Go to the [Swagger UI](https://freeapihub.onrender.com/api-docs).
2. Choose an endpoint (e.g., `GET /books` for all books or `GET /books/{id}` for a specific book).
3. Click **Try it out** and **Execute** to see the response.

### Conclusion

The Swagger UI allows you to easily test **FreeApiHub** APIs in real time. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
