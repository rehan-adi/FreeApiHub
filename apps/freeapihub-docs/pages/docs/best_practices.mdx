# Best Practices for Handling APIs in React/Next.js

## Introduction

When building production-grade applications with **React** or **Next.js**, itâ€™s essential to handle APIs and state management efficiently. This guide will cover best practices to help you maintain clean, performant, and scalable code when interacting with APIs.

### 1. Using `useEffect` and `useState` for Fetching Data

In React, the **`useEffect`** hook is commonly used for side-effects, like fetching data from an API when a component mounts. Here's how you can handle API requests in a clean, efficient way using **`useState`** and **`useEffect`**:

### Example: Fetching Data with `useEffect`

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function BooksList() {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchBooks = async () => {
      setLoading(true); // Reset loading to true whenever data is being fetched
      try {
        const response = await fetch("https://freeapihub.onrender.com/books");
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch books");
        const data = await response.json();
        setBooks(data);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false); // Set loading to false once the fetching is done
      }
    };

    fetchBooks();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures it runs once when the component mounts

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Books</h1>
      <ul>
        {books.map((book) => (
          <li key={book.id}>{book.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Next js

If you are using Next.js you need to add this on top of your file to make it client component 

```bash
"use client"
```

### Key Points:

- **useEffect**: Used to fetch data when the component mounts (by passing an empty array [] as the second argument).
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors when dealing with API requests.
- **State Management**: Use useState for loading, data, and error states.

### Conclusion

Handling API requests effectively in React or Next.js involves a combination of state management, error handling, and performance optimization techniques. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your application performs well and remains maintainable as it scales.
